#' The package was developed to be understandable for beginners, so some functions aim to transform processes that would be
#' complex into functions with a few lines. The main advantage of using the 'metools' package is the ease of producing reports and
#' working with time series using a few lines of code, so the code is clean and easy to understand/maintain.
