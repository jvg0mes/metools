\description{
The 'metools' package provides a number of functions to facilitate the handling and production of reports using time series data.
The package was developed to be understandable for beginners, so some functions aim to transform processes that would be
complex into functions with a few lines. The main advantage of using the 'metools' package is the ease of producing reports and
working with time series using a few lines of code, so the code is clean and easy to understand/maintain.
